              My journey began in the refugee camps of Tanzania, where life's
              essentials were a luxury and dreams were the only sanctuary.
              Amidst the uncertainty, there was a constant‚Äîfaith. It was this
              faith that carried us through, a testament to resilience and hope.

              Hi my name is Bruce Niyibitanga - yes I know what you're thinking
              - 'Bruce what?!, how do you even pronounce that?' Haha It's
              actually pronounced as 'Nee yee bee tounge ga' hopefully that
              helps üôÇ. I'm the founder of Xenova. My journey to founding Xenova
              is deeply intertwined with my own life experiences. Born into the
              hardships of a Tanzanian refugee, I learned early on the value of
              resilience, community, and hope. It was there, amid scarcity and
              uncertainty, that I discovered the profound impact of support and
              the difference it can make in a person's life.
            </p>

            <p>
              These lessons have been the bedrock upon which Xenova was built.
