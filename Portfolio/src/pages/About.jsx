              My journey began in the refugee camps of Tanzania, where life's
              essentials were a luxury and dreams were the only sanctuary.
              Amidst the uncertainty, there was a constantâ€”faith. It was this
              faith that carried us through, a testament to resilience and hope.

              Hi my name is Bruce Niyibitanga - yes I know what you're thinking
              - 'Bruce what?!, how do you even pronounce that?' Haha It's
              actually pronounced as 'Nee yee bee tounge ga' hopefully that
              helps ðŸ™‚. I'm the founder of Xenova. My journey to founding Xenova
              is deeply intertwined with my own life experiences. Born into the
              hardships of a Tanzanian refugee, I learned early on the value of
              resilience, community, and hope. It was there, amid scarcity and
              uncertainty, that I discovered the profound impact of support and
              the difference it can make in a person's life.

            <p>
              These lessons have been the bedrock upon which Xenova was built.

              being a force for good in the communities that need it most.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every project at Xenova is infused with this spirit of generosity.
              We believe in the power of technology to create opportunities, to
              bridge divides, and to foster a sense of belonging.
            </p>
            <p>
              We delve into the heart of your mission, bringing to life a
              digital platform that's not just a site, but a destination. A
              place where every click reveals a story, every interface connects,
              and every user experience becomes a cherished interaction. With
              Xenova, your digital presence is an extension of your
              visionâ€”crafted with care, designed with purpose, and built to
