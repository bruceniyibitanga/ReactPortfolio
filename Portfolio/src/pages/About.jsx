              Born in the refugee camps of
              <span className="highlight">Tanzania, Africa</span> life was
              difficult. However, through it all God sustained and protected us.
              Life was uncertain, food and water scarce and all that I dreamed
              about about as a child was a place that I could call home. A home
              free for worry, hunger and pain...

              Hi my name is Bruce Niyibitanga - yes I know what you're thinking
              - 'Bruce what?!, how do you even pronounce that?' Haha It's
              actually pronounced as 'Nee yee bee tounge ga' hopefully that
              helps ðŸ™‚. I'm the eldest of 7 children (5 girls and 1 little
              brother). Coming to Australia in 2005 was an amazing opportunity
              for a new life and new beginnings. Among the many opportunities
              that Australia offered, education and an ability to freely express
              myself without fear of reprisal were some of its greatest gifts.

              So fast forward to today, I work as a christian missionary with an
              amazing passion for photography and videography and software
              development. I love to capture amazing memories that are worth
              remembering. It's soo rewarding to see when someone can look at
              themselves and truly feel and look beautiful.
